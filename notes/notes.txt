 - Product will ship with a barebones html frame containing
   recommended containers. These files will be commented
   with instructions for customization. Certain pages must
   exist for expected behavior, but adding pages is
   encouraged and editing the code can allow for changing
   existing behavior or adding entirely new ones (user stats,
   archiving, groups, get creative!).

 - Posts list on each user's page can be filtered, displaying
   only post numbers a to b, where a defaults to the most
   recent post and b defaults to the tenth most recent post.
   HTML requests can specify other values for a and b, thus
   allowing a paging list to be implemented.

 - Special user groups to restrict functionality. Post
   timeouts, replies only, no images, etc. Edit the .ldif
   client side?

 - Generating stats for specific users. Number of posts,
   total upload amount, file size uploads over time, 
   remaining data allowance, etc.

 - Linking to other posts within posts, perhaps maybe even
   a mouseover preview of the linked post? When a post is
   linked, a reference can be made to the linking post
   allowing for a list of referencing posts.

 - Program periodically checks the users table for any entries
   that exceed the expiry period and have not been assigned a
   username and password. These entries are deleted. Also
   periodically deletes images from the image directory either
   at specified dates or when disk usage exceeds a given
   value.
